# ef2so - An Entity Facts-To-Schema-org Converter
This is an on-demand [Entity Facts](http://www.dnb.de/entityfacts) (EF) to Schema.org Converter. That means, that the transformation work will be done in the moment of access! URL schema is `http://www.example.org:8080/yourpath/{GND-IDN}`.

*Online Demo:* https://ef2sop2000451198trial.hanatrial.ondemand.com/118540238
## Entity types
- Supported: `organisation`, `person` and `place`
- *Unsupported*: `family` (due to a lack in Schema.org)

2. Get data from Entity Facts: http://hub.culturegraph.org/entityfacts/118540238
3. Transform data (JSON-LD to JSON-LD): Transformation ([Mapping](blob/master/src/main/resources/ef2so_transformation.xml)) is made with [Metafacture](https://github.com/metafacture/metafacture-core)
